# 🧠 Welcome to the 2025 SURGE NeuroHackathon!

Welcome to the **SURGE NeuroHackathon 2025**, where you'll get hands-on experience developing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and analyzing neural data. Over the course of this weekend, you'll work in teams to prototype applications using EEG signals.

# 🏆 Challenge Streams
We have **two challenge tracks** you can choose from:

## **1️⃣ Brain-Controlled Applications (Real-Time BCI)**
**Challenge:** Develop an application where EEG signals **control an interaction or interface** in real time.

🎯 **Goal:** Use real-time EEG to build a brain-controlled game, assistive tool, interactive experience, or whatever you brainstorm!

**Example Ideas:**
   - A **mind-controlled game** (e.g., Pong, Flappy Bird)
   - A **P300 or SSVEP-based communication device**
   - A **mind-controlled music device**

### Real-Time BCI Deliverables

- **Project Presentation** (8 minutes max) - See the [rubric for details.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md#brain-controlled-applications-real-time-bci-stream) A general template for your presentation could include:
  -  Problem Statement & Motivation  
  - System Design & Implementation 
  - A live Demonstration (or a pre-recorded demo if real-time is not possible)  
  - Results & Interpretation (system performance, user interaction)
  - Challenges & Future Work
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) – Should include:  
  - Your code, presentation and instructions for running the project (a readme file)


## **2️⃣ Offline EEG Data Analysis & Machine Learning**
**Challenge:** Analyze pre-recorded EEG data to extract insights, build predictive models, classify brain signals/states, or detect anomalies.

🎯 **Goal:** Process pre-recorded EEG signals to classify brain signals/sates, detect anomalies, or investigate neural patterns.

**BCI Dataset:** For this stream we have provided three datasets of EEG recordings from participants subjected to various experimental conditions designed to elicit specific neural responses. For more information on the provided dataset, please refer to the [dataset description](./offline-analysis-stream/dataset_description.md).
- **You may find and use a different dataset for your analysis**. However, if you choose to use another dataset, volunteers may not be able to provide as much support. 
  - If you choose to use another dataset, please ensure it is publicly available and provide a link to it in your submission.

### Offline EEG Data/ML Deliverables

- **Project Presentation** (8 minutes max) - see the [rubric for details.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md#offline-eeg-data-analysis--machine-learning-stream) A general template for your presentation could include:
  - Problem Statement & Motivation  
  - What you did with the data (preprocessing, analysis, modeling) 
  - Results & Interpretation (accuracy, feature importance, visualization of findings)  
  - Challenges & Future Work  
- **Report (Recommended)** – A Jupyter Notebook or PDF report summarizing:
  - Your data analysis process (where did you start, what did you try, what worked) and key insights; visualizations, results, and interpretation of findings.
- **Code Repository** (GitHub or Zip file) – Should include:  
  - Your code/analyses, presentation and instructions for running the project (a readme file)

# 📩 Submission Information

- **Submission Deadline: Sunday, 1:00 PM**
- **Submission Format:** A **presentation** followed by a **5-minute Q&A** session from the judges.
  - Order of team presentations will be decided at random.
- **Judging Criteria:** Projects will be evaluated based on the [rubrics provided for each challenge stream.](./resources/judging_rubrics.md)
- **Prizes:** This event has a $1200 prize pool! The top two teams in each challenge stream will be awarded prizes.
  - **🥇 First place teams will receive $400**
  - **🥈 Second place teams will receive $200**

### Submission Process
- **How to Submit:**  
  - Upload your presentation, code, reports, and any other relevant files to your Github repository.
    - If files are too large, or you don't have a Github repository, you can submit a zip file.
    - Ensure it includes a *README* explaining about (and how to run/use) your project. 
  - **[Submit through the submission form]()**
- **NOTE:** If you submit multiple times, only your most recent submission made before the submission deadline (1:00 pm on Sunday) will be considered. Submissions received after the deadline will not be accepted.
