# Mapping Stress with EEG

This program will display a calming image to the user if increased levels of stress are detected. 

## Installation

You will need a Python IDE as well as an 8-channel OpenBCI EEG connected to your scalp in the 10-20 system. The program also requires the installation of a Brainflow IDE. 

## Usage

Once you have connected to the EEG, run the program and remain as still as possible for the first 5 seconds of the program. Closing your eyes and maintaining steady breathing will also help the program calibrate to your natural brain waves. 

Continue running the program while engaging in a task that could increase your stress levels. The program will display an image if your brain waves indicate an increased level of stress. If you feel yourself becoming more relaxed due to the image, close the image display window. The program will continue analysing your brain waves when the image is closed.
